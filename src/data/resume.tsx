This library leverages Spring Boot Aspects, Jackson, and Core Java. I created it as an alternative to Redis, addressing the challenge of limited RAM by avoiding in-memory storage. This solution allows for efficient caching of JSON or string data on servers with available disk space, providing a practical caching option when RAM is constrained.",
